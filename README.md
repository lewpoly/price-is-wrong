# The Price is Wrong
This is a simple group project utilizing base modules with Node.js to be able to create a server, without the help of Express. Simply press the button to receive the first item, and then if you guess the price in 3 attempts, you win! Otherwise, play again!





## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.JS

This project was mostly build using Node.js in mind, and focusing on the http and fs modules specifically, without the use of Express, to gain a more solid understanding of how servers work and an appreciation that it is so much simpler now with tools such as Express.

## Optimizations

Creating a rewrite function to be able to reduce lines of code and make switching between pages when it is a read request much easier to read for humans. Creating a class constructor for the Items to make adding more items easy. May later integrate MongoDB and Express, possibly in a separate repo, to allow the user to add more items to the database. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned that Express really makes life so much easier  when working on the backend, as having to manually decide what every single file does and how the server handles them is time consuming and creates a lot of harder to read code.
